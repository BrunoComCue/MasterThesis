# MasterThesis
Tracking system known as SimpleLife developed for a Master Thesis written by Bruno Comesa√±a Cuervo for the master's program in Space Robotics and Automation at Aalto University

Title: General-Purpose Model-Free Object Tracking with 3D LiDAR


Most of the base code and structure is heavily based on the [SimpleTrack](https://github.com/tusen-ai/SimpleTrack.git) work, so the documentation can be found there

[Immortal Tracker](https://github.com/BrunoComCue/ImmortalTracker.git)  and [CenterPoint](https://github.com/BrunoComCue/CenterPoint.git) have been also very important inspiration sources
