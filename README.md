# MasterThesis
Tracking system known as SimpleLife developed for a Master Thesis written by Bruno Comesaña Cuervo for the master's program in Space Robotics and Automation at Aalto University (soon to be uploaded)

Title: General-Purpose Model-Free Object Tracking with 3D LiDAR


Most of the base code and structure is heavily based on the [SimpleTrack](https://github.com/tusen-ai/SimpleTrack.git) work, so the documentation can be found there
